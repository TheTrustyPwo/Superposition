# Introduction
Before getting into the technicalities and specifics of diffraction and interference, why don't we have a quick recap or learn about the basics? 

## What are waves?
  
### Definition of a wave
A wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities. A wave transfers energy from one point to another without transferring the medium of the wave. <br>
*For example, sound is produced through the oscillations of air molecules (waves). The sound energy is transferred from the source to the listener’s ear, but the air molecules are not.*

### Wave Classifications
The two most studied waves in classical physics as well as in H2 physics are mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves.

| Type of Wave | Explanation | 
|---|---|
| Mechanical | - Defined as the oscillation of matter, therefore it transfers energy through a physical medium <br> - The material must have inertia and elasticity, so the maximum displacement of the material is not far from the position of equilibrium <br> - 3 types of mechanical waves: transverse waves, longitudinal waves and surface waves <br> - *Examples: sound waves, oscillating string* | 
| Electromagnetic (EM) | - Produced by a changing electric field that induces a changing magnetic field or vice versa <br> - Electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other <br> - Can travel through a vacuum (no medium) at the speed of light, 3.00 $\times$ 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup> <br> - *Examples: x-ray, gamma ray, visible light* <br> <img src="em.png" width="500px"> |

<br>
Only transverse waves and longitudinal waves are covered in the A-level H2 Physics syllabus. 

| Type of Wave | Explanation |
|---|---| 
| Transverse | - Oscillates perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave <br> - Has crests (peaks) and troughs (valleys) <br> - *Examples: electromagnetic (EM) waves, water waves* | 
| Longitudinal | - Oscillates parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave <br> - Has compressions (regions of high pressure) and rarefactions (regions of low pressure) <br> - *Examples: sound waves* | 
| Surface | - Propagates along the boundary between two different materials (for example: water waves* occur on the boundary between liquid and gas) <br> - Consists of Love waves (transverse motion) or Rayleigh waves (transverse and longitudinal motion) <br> - *Examples: ocean waves, seismic waves* | 

**Water waves are a combination of transverse, longitudinal and surface waves, but is not a Rayleigh wave as water particles move in circular paths while Rayleigh waves move in elliptical paths*

3. Mode of Motion

| Type of Wave | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Progressive | - Transfers energy, does not store energy <br> - Propagates through a medium <br> - All points have the same maximum amplitude <br> - Does not have nodes (amplitude = 0 at all times) or antinodes (amplitude = maximum displacement at all times) <br> - Points exactly a wavelength apart are in phase | 
| Standing | - Stores energy, does not transfer energy <br> - Overall wave does not move <br> - Each point has different amplitude <br> - Has nodes and antinodes <br> - Only nodes and antinodes are in phase |

### Wave terms 

| Term | Definition | 
|---|---| 
| Amplitude | Maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position | 
| Period | The time taken by a particle to make one complete oscillation or by a source to produce one complete cycle of wave | 
| Frequency | Number of complete oscillations made by a particle or number of cycles of wave produced by a source in one second | 
| Phase | Usually measured in degrees or radians, refers to the current position of a wave cycle relative to a reference point | 
| Wavelength | Distance between two consecutive points in phase | 
| Wave speed | Distance travelled per second by a wave profile| 

## Key Formulae Summary:

1. Wave Speed <br>
The speed \(v\) of a wave is given by the product of its frequency \(f\) and wavelength \(\lambda\):

$$
v = f \lambda
$$

2. Frequency <br>
The frequency f of a wave is the number of oscillations per unit time:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

where T is the period of the wave (the time it takes for one complete oscillation).

3. Wavelength <br>
Wavelength $\lambda$ is the distance between two consecutive points in phase on the wave (e.g., crest to crest, trough to trough):

$$
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
$$

4. Standing Wave Condition <br>
For standing waves on a string fixed at both ends, the wavelengths $\lambda_n$ are given by:

$$
\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}
$$

where:

- L is the length of the string,
- n is the mode number (integer).

The corresponding frequencies $f_n$ are:

$$
f_n = \frac{n v}{2L}
$$
